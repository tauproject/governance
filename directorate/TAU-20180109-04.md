# Tau Hypercomputing Facility
## Directive TAU:20180109/04: Tau Project

[![Classification: UNRESTRICTED][classification]](#classification)
[![Status: In force][status]](#status)

### Context

The Directorate previously requested Technical Strategy (“TECHSTRAT”) define a strategy for:—

1. making selected Tau Hypercomputing Facility components available to the public as open source software (“OSS”); and
2. engaging with the OSS community in future development of these components.

TECHSTRAT submitted a proposal, known as the “Tau Project”, for approval by the Directorate which has been ratified as described [below](#directive).

### Directive

1. This directive applies only to materials which:—
	1. are classified as **UNRESTRICTED**;
	2. have been developed as part of the **SHIMMER** release track (and  subsequent releases); and
	2. have been developed internally, or have been licensed from third parties pursuant to terms enabling OSS release.
2. TECHSTRAT shall:—
	1. create a list of common copyright licenses suitable for use; consulting with the Legal Services Directorate (“LS”);
	2. jointly with Technical Operations (“TECHOPS”) and LS, determine the most appropriate:—
		1. public hosting facilities; and
		2. automated testing facilities for published materials;
	3. jointly with the Communications Directorate (“COMMS”), TECHOPS and LS:—
		1. determine how to most effectively communicate the availability of these materials to the public;
		2. provide sufficient context that they are meaningful, useful and support on-going engagement; and
		3. minimise risk of compromise of normal operations through, e.g., non-core communications being elevated to unsustainable levels; and
	4. make relevant governance materials, including the decisions referenced in subsection (2) above, as well as this directive, available to the public for inspection.
3. TECHOPS shall:—
	1. arrange the publication of source code and other related materials on one or more public source code hosting facilities;
	2. ensure that published materials are accompanied by licensing statements detailing permitting reuse;
	3. publish “container images” consistent with those deployed internally, created using mechanisms transparent to the public;
	4. provide instructions on public use of these materials;
	5. arrange for released projects to be tested through automated means in line with best practices;
	6. take steps to ensure that any personal or otherwise sensitive information is expunged from materials that are published, including those which arise as a result of normal development processes (e.g., audit logs), and that sensitive operational data is maintained separately from any OSS;
	7. extend mandatory training of staff to include knowledge of OSS development processes and awareness of the implications of working with open source materials.
4. The Directorate requests:—
	1. that LS perform periodic audits to ensure compliance in line with its normal regulatory functions; and
	2. that COMMS monitor the impact of this directive upon:—
		1. the public, particularly within the OSS community; and
		2. staff whose role requires they come into contact with the public.
5. It is noted and agreed that:—
	1. nothing in this directive shall be taken to override the standing requirements of operational security and integrity;
	2. the OSS community is not generally inhibited by lack of warranties nor formal support arrangements; and
	3. implementation of this directive shall be absorbed into normal running costs.

### Risk assessment

| ID | Risk | Impact | Severity |  Likelihood<sup>†</sup> | Mitigation |
|----|------|--------|----------| -------------|------------|
| R1 | Identifying information pertaining to staff, contractors and concerned third parties may be released to the public | Duty of care; operational compromise | Severe | High | [3.6] TECHOPS shall develop processes to ensure any personal information is expunged from materials.<br><br>[3.7] TECHOPS shall extend training to ensure awareness of OSS implications. |
| R2 | Sensitive technical operational details may be released to the public | Operational compromise | Severe | Moderate | [3.6] TECHOPS shall ensure any such information is maintained separately from OSS materials, where it is not already. |
| R3 | Public may expect a level of support/warranty of released materials that cannot be provided by TECHOPS | Reputation | Moderate | Low | [5.1] COMMS shall monitor the impact of this directive upon the public.<br><br>[5.2] The OSS community has well-established reasonable expectation levels. |
| R4 | Increased visibility may result in significantly elevated non-core inquiries | Value | Moderate | Low | [2.3.3] TECHSTRAT, TECHOPS, COMMS and LS shall co-ordinate inorder to ensure that such an impact is minimised.<br><br>[4.2.2] COMMS shall monitor the impact upon public-facing staff. |
| R5 | Impact may be insufficiently high to represent value | Value | Low | Low | [2.3.1] TECHSTRAT, TECHOPS, COMMS and LS shall co-ordinate in implementing an effective communications strategy.<br><br>[5.3] The Directorate is satisfied that TECHOPS procedures required to implement this directive either constitute BAU or are of marginal additional cost. |
